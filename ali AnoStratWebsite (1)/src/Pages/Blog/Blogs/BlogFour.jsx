                            Financial inclusion: Fintech progressively boosts
                            financial inclusion for Pakistani citizens who have
                            been excluded from the formal financial system.
                            Fintech companies can be mindful of their target

                            breaches and cyberattacks are rampant in modern
                            times. Fintechs storing and processing large amounts
                            of sensitive customer data, can become victims of
                            cyberattacks and data breaches. By investing in
                            cybersecurity methods, fintech ventures can
                            conveniently protect their customers’ data.

                            them. For example, products or services need to

                            sign up so they are protected from frauds including
